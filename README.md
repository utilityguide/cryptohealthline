its not a Digital Currency in any mean its more like shapeshift however runing ethereum based contract to commit like exodus protofilio wallet but with special USP added init.
these are place in etherum smart contracts to time lock their worth in different currencies ( perhaps integrating shapeshift and exodus)
following that purpose of this contract should be to allow end user to easy access to self generated contract with his own self.
locking assets in a timelock,unlocking,extracting, redistributing seeds, swapping into different assets(shapeshift)
